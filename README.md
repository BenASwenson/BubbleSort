# BubbleSort
## The BubbleSort class uses the bubbleSort() method to take an array of ints and, using the bubble sort algorithm, returns the array with its elements stored in ascending order.

- bubbleSort() repeatedly iterates over the array and compares the adjacent element
- based on the comparison it swaps the element if it is in the wrong order
- at the end of every iteration the largest element will get accumulated at the end of the array
- the array will be sorted after all iterations

##### The class Starter is used to implement any solutions with created objects from the BubbleSort class using the start() method.  This way we can keep the Main() method clean by only calling Starter.start();

## The BubbleSortTests class uses jUnit jupiter testing with various methods to decipher if the passed integer arrays sort appropriately.
